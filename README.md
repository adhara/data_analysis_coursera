data_analysis_coursera
======================

My scripts for lectures and exercises from Johns Hopkins specialization on Data Science at coursera.org, taught by professors Jeffrey Leek, Roger Peng and Brian Caffo.

Obs.: Scripts I write for assignments WILL NOT be added to this repo. They will be saved to a private repo in order to avoid any problems.
